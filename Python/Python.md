Python is a high-level, dynamically-typed language where code blocks are defined by indentation rather than braces. It emphasizes readability (see PEPÂ 8).
Assignment is by reference (names bind to objects), and mutable vs immutable types behave differently under aliasing (e.g. two names can refer to the same list).
