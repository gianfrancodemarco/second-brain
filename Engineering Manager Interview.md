**Q:** **Talk me about yourself**
A: I'm a Software & Data Engineer and I've got about 7+ yoe across different roles and companies. Actually, I've been studying computer science since high school, and after that I've enrolled in Computer Science university for my bachelor's degree, while at the same time, starting my professional career. After my bachelor's, I've enrolled for a master's degree in computer science and specifically in Artificial Intelligence and I graduated from that last year.
Regarding my professional experience, I've started with full stack roles but soon moved to more backend tailored roles.
Most of the times I've worked in Python, both in my professional career and university career, since I've been doing Machine Learning, computer vision and stuff like that.
For my 2 most recent roles I've worked as Data Engineer, even if actually my roles have been wider, since being the only member of the Data Teams at these companies, I've had the ownership of designing the data infrastructure, modeling the data, implementing the data solutions and pipelines and monitoring them.

Q: Having worked as a data engineer, why are you applying back to Software Engineer positions
A: Following my interest and studies in data and AI, I moved into more data-focused engineering roles, where I built end-to-end data platforms for my companies. As the sole member of these teams, I covered the full data flow, including designing pipelines, ETL, visualization, and reporting. While I enjoyed the technical challenges, the visualization and reporting aspects were less aligned with my core interests, and I realized I wanted to focus more on backend and system engineering.
The skills I developed in data engineering—Python, pipelines, APIs, and architecture—are directly transferable to software engineering roles. I also understand that Nearform works with data-intensive applications, so this role offers a good balance between my interests in technical software development and my experience with data

Q: Why you want to work at Nearform?
A: Well first of all, for my understanding, Nearform is a place where you colsuntancy in a good way, which means that you do curated and cool projects, and being a colsuntancy firm you also have the chance to see different things and improve in different aspects; About this, i also think that i will find really skilled colleagues, with which we can share knowledge and all grow together; i've also done a bit of research online and i've found really good reviews about the company from the employees; also, working in open source (idk if this is happening for Python rn but maybe will in the future), is a great philosophy, and allows our work to be used from a lot of people, which is a fullifilling aspect,and last, i think the pay and benefit and career progression are really good
