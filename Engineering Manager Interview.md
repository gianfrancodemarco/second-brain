**Q:** **Talk me about yourself**
A: I'm a Software & Data Engineer and I've got about 7+ yoe across different roles and companies. Actually, I've been studying computer science since high school, and after that I've enrolled in Computer Science university for my bachelor's degree, while at the same time, starting my professional career. After my bachelor's, I've enrolled for a master's degree in computer science and specifically in Artificial Intelligence and I graduated from that last year.
Regarding my professional experience, I've started with full stack roles but soon moved to more backend tailored roles.
Most of the times I've worked in Python, both in my professional career and university career, since I've been doing Machine Learning, computer vision and stuff like that.
For my 2 most recent roles I've worked as Data Engineer, even if actually my roles have been wider, since being the only member of the Data Teams at these companies, I've had the ownership of designing the data infrastructure, modeling the data, implementing the data solutions and pipelines and monitoring them.

**Q: Having worked as a data engineer, why are you applying back to Software Engineer positions**
A: Following my interest and studies in data and AI, I moved into more data-focused engineering roles, where I built end-to-end data platforms for my companies. As the sole member of these teams, I covered the full data flow, including designing pipelines, ETL, visualization, and reporting. While I enjoyed the technical challenges, the visualization and reporting aspects were less aligned with my core interests, and I realized I wanted to focus more on backend and system engineering.
The skills I developed in data engineering—Python, pipelines, APIs, and architecture—are directly transferable to software engineering roles. I also understand that Nearform works with data-intensive applications, so this role offers a good balance between my interests in technical software development and my experience with data

**Q: Why you want to work at Nearform?**
A: I’m interested in Nearform because it combines consultancy with high-quality, diverse projects. This environment allows me to tackle different technical challenges and continuously grow. I’m also drawn to the opportunity to work with skilled colleagues, share knowledge, and contribute to a culture of learning. I’ve seen excellent employee reviews and appreciate Nearform’s involvement in open source, which aligns with my philosophy of building software that benefits a wide community. Finally, the role offers clear career progression and benefits, which makes it an attractive long-term opportunity

**Q: Tell me about your experience with Python-based systems.**
A: I've been using python since high-school for school and personal projects. Then in university it was my first language choice, both for bachelor's projects and definetly for master's where i've done a little bit of ML projects, computer vision projects and NLP projects.
Professionally, I've been using python in my last 3 experiences, with different frameworks and settings.
In my oldest one, I built extensions for CKAN, an open source data management system written in Python, with Flask and Jinja
In my experience in hlpy, we had a microservice architecture, leveraging docker and kubernetes.
Most of the systems leveraged starlette as asgi framework, pydantic, alembic for datbase versioning, sqlalchemy as orm.
I also introduced Airflow for workflow management and i implemented a few pipelines using python.
At my current role, i'
